# Effective NLP ML pipelines: What are the characteristics? 

One of the main important features of a reliable ML NLP pipeline is that it should incorporate the elements of  MLOps. NlPp pipelines are a series of interconnected data processing components that work together
analyze natural language data using machine learning techniques. 


### just note-taking 

Remote surveys for medical natural language processing are costly, especially if the demand is for a new domain in the medical spectrum. The process of collecting natural language processing medical knowledge requires expanding and transforming the questions when the group of researchers can respond spontaneously across a wide demographic area. When the survey asks for sensitive information the whole standard of data acquisition changes, to effectively collect medical data a portfolio of remote methods should be leveraged.
For instance, chatbots have the advantage of delivering intervention and acute interactions. The other benefit of using a chatbot to collect a certain type of NLP medical knowledge is its capacity of replicate the interaction occurring between the patients and the doctors of other medical staff. Beside this with the data acquisition through chatbots it is possible to develop the context around the specific medical domain.

### What does pipeline mean in the context of natural language processing? 

This included several stages. The initialization of the pipeline commences with the data collection. [talk about advanced data collection techniques in NLP]
The follow-up to this process is the preprocessing stage [change the word here]. 
Researchers need to be able to recruit large and often specialized crowdsourcing of the data. This often happens in categorical data acquisition. This should be done with as low expenditure as possible. 
For Example in the context of medicine, the conventional method of data acquisition can be both time and money-consuming. [A system that data is contributed freely]
one method is to practice advertising small self-contained tasks on the web. Besides this in medical NLP data gathering the answer should be valid and high quality.  
A method to collect medical data is to leverage Amazon Turk crowdsourcing tools But this tool is highly beneficial for nonspecific normative datasets.  
with Amazon Turk crowdsourcing tools the demographic can be limiting. 


another example similar to this method of NLP data gathering is the use of
