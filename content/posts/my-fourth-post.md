## Active Learning: The most mysterious concept there is
<p>I start this by saying that reversing  the learning habits is a lot of work, therefore I wish there was a subject at schools early on to teach youth about active learning strategies for each specific field. Active learning in math hugely differs from progressive active learning in coding. We should look at what solidifies the endpoint in-demand skill set, then work backward from there and design a gradual learning step that accords with the flow theory.</p>

<p> Without the consideration of flow theory, the level of mental resistance is high and individuals find themselves disengaged in the early stages of learning. In other words, the burden of courses outweighs the desire for successful learning. Without supervision and an encouraging environment, the resistance to follow through exponentially increases.</p>
